      <h2>Trump's Mission: Make America Great Again</h2>
      <p>
        President Donald Trump has always stood for a clear, unwavering mission: to restore the greatness of the United States of America. His "America First" policy has placed the needs of American citizens above global interests, reaffirming our strength and independence on the world stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        He brought jobs back to the U.S., negotiated better trade deals like USMCA, and enforced immigration laws to protect American families.
      </p>
      <p>
        His mission continues: defend free speech, uphold the Second Amendment, dismantle globalist control, finish the wall, and ensure that the American Dream remains alive for generations to come.
